# Unity-TopDownCameraController
 A barebones 3D top-down free-movement camera controller.

Ideally suited for prototypes and experimentation. Confirmed to work with Unity 2021.3 but should work for all recent Unity versions.

WARNING: Uses the old Input Manager system. Does not work with the new UnityEngine.Input API.

## Features
- Horizontal movement
- Vertical movement
- Forward/backward movement
- Camera angle adjustment
- Clamped parameters for ease of adjustment
